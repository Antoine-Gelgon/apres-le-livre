(88, 'Ellen Lupton', 'Reading and Writing', '2010', 'minuit', ' Â«To give a text an Author is to pose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing.Â»\r\nâ€”Roland Barthes, 1968\r\n Long ago and far away, Roland Barthes pronounced Â«the death of the author.Â» The year was 1968 and the place was Paris, \r\nepicenter of the postmodern mindset. Banished to the grave was the myth of the artist as sole originator of a work, an \r\nautonomous creator whose life story and personal psychology might unlock a sacred inner truth. The text became a nexus \r\nof connections at the mercy of history, context, and use. Closing the authorâ€™s casket meant liberating a new figureâ€”the reaÂ­\r\nderâ€”to find and construct meaning: Â«The reader is the space on which all the quotations that make up a writing are inscriÂ­\r\nbed; a textâ€™s unity lies not in its origins but in its destination.Â»1 The author was dead, and the reader was born.\r\nDid the author truly perish, or did he stumble off to heal himself, returning as a different kind of creature, monstrous \r\nperhaps, or fractured into a million little pieces? What status do Â«the authorÂ» and Â«the readerÂ» hold today within the disÂ­\r\ncourse of design and within the broader techÂ­saturated culture? How have the roles of reader and writer, sender and receiÂ­\r\nver, evolved in our networked, openÂ­sourced, allÂ­in media world? The phrase Â«designer as authorÂ» has stirred two decades of \r\ndebates about designâ€™s agency (or lack thereof) in the manufacture of content, while successive generations of makers have \r\nplunged into the surging workflow of reading, writing, editing, and publishing. The process of design (a tool that anyone can \r\nuse) has become more important than the identity of designers (a specialized caste of professionals).\r\n Taking on the role of producer, many contemporary designers are pursuing selfÂ­initiated endeavors alongside commercial \r\nwork, seeking balance between personal and economic satisfaction. They are building collaborative businesses while organiÂ­\r\nzing exhibitions and publishing books, blogs, and magazines. Enabled by digital distribution systems, todayâ€™s long tail media \r\necology harbors an endless range of niche markets, inviting new players to jump in and reap rewards whose value is more \r\nsocial than monetary. It is against this backdrop of a pragmatic, collaborative, handsÂ­on creative community that we revisit \r\nquestions about the life and death of reading, writing, and graphic design.\r\nThe Designer as Author\r\n Letâ€™s begin this story of calamity and renewal by reviewing graphic designâ€™s troubled narrative about authorship. Itâ€™s a tale \r\nthat hinges on our Oedipal battle with clients and contentÂ­makers, fought from our gravyÂ­stained seats at the kidsâ€™ table. \r\nWhat does authorship mean within graphic designâ€™s own anxious discourse? Does becoming an author entail forging a \r\ndistinctive visual approachâ€”a recognizable style equivalent to the signature voice of a writerâ€”or does authorship require \r\noriginating content and initiating projects? Design critic Rick Poynor helped launch this nowÂ­familiar debate in 1991 with \r\nhis article Â«The Designer as Author,Â» published in the prominent UK magazine Blueprint. Back in that mindÂ­blinding period \r\nof typographic invention, Â«new waveÂ» designers like Neville Brody and Jonathan Barnbrook were creating subversive visual \r\nreadings of given texts. Poynor, looking at the practice of an notating a clientâ€™s message with layers of visual complexity, \r\napproached his subject with both interest and skepticism, wondering when these gifted and formÂ­frenzied designers would \r\nfigure out what they wanted to say.2\r\n As founding editor of Eye magazine, Poynor commissioned Michael Rock to write a piece on Â«The Designer as Author.Â»3 \r\nPublished in 1996, Rockâ€™s farÂ­ranging critique took note of numerous modes of design authorship (illustrated books, artists \r\nbooks, portfolio monographs, curated exhibitions, and so on), but like Poynor, Rock was especially interested in designers \r\nwhose distinctive methods constituted their own form of invention. Rockâ€™s piece inspired a wave of wouldÂ­be design \r\nauthors, especially among those who equated authorship with selfÂ­initiated projects. Rock became the unwilling poster \r\nchild of a Â«designer as authorÂ» epidemic, even though his essay had sought, at bottom, to cast doubt on the cult of content, \r\nencourag ing designers instead to focus on visual techniques that construct meaning above and beyond that of the text or \r\nmessage.\r\n Lashing back, Rock published his passionate rant Â«Fuck ContentÂ» in 2005. Rock admonished designers to focus on how \r\nthings look and how they communicate, not on what the message is: Â«to fully recuperate design from its secondÂ­class status \r\nunder the thumb of content you must... say that treatment is a kind of text itself, equal to, and as complex and referential \r\nas, traditional forms of content. The materiality of a designerâ€™s method is his or her content and through those material/ \r\nvisual moves, a designer speaks.Â»4 Rock confronted headÂ­on the anxiety many designers feel about their marginal role in the \r\ncommunications cycleâ€”called in at the end of the process to make things look good. According to Rock, designers are better \r\noff asserting the importance of frameÂ­making and formÂ­giving than trying to borrow prestige from the Author (a figure who, \r\nafter all, is long since dead and departed). Dmitri Siegel delivered a similar scold on Design Observer, asking, Â«Is the allure \r\nof the legitimacy of authorship pulling design away from the defining characteristic of the professionâ€”the designer/client \r\nrelationship?Â» Siegel warned that designers who want to produce their own content wonâ€™t find much of an audience anyway \r\nand will have bigger impact doing client work in the commercial arena.5\r\n Ignoring such stern counsel, count less designers have kept at it anyway, embracing the tasks of writing, editing, and puÂ­\r\nblishing alongside layout and typography. Publishing books has become the site of heated social activity, as seen in the rash \r\nof book fairs and shortÂ­run publishing houses worldwide. Liner Notes (2009), a book about the art of book design, speaks in \r\nseveral registers about the sudden outbreak of independent publishing. Created by a team of young designers and editors, \r\nLiner Notes is packed with photographs depicting books in a living human context: books are handled, sorted, and stacked, \r\nrarely isolated as pristine objects. The authors of Liner Notes ask, Â«What does it mean to design a book? As design produces \r\nan independent text, the designerâ€™s role could be compared to that of an author. As design marks a position regarding the \r\ncontent, the designerâ€™s frame of action could be compared to that of a critic.Â»6 While such a statement falls in line with Rockâ€™s insistence on formÂ­making as contentÂ­making, these designers have become authors in a more direct sense as well, \r\ngathering material for their own book and writing page after page of text. Liner Notes speaks in a loose, conversational tone; \r\na similar demeanor characterizes much contemporary design authorship, where transcripts and notes take precedence over \r\ncarefully crafted argumentsâ€”more chat than treatise.7 Liner Notes was published by Spector Books (Leipzig), one among \r\ndozens of small publishing houses that have sprung up in recent years, including Roma Publications (Netherlands) and OccaÂ­\r\nsional Papers (London).\r\nThese smallÂ­scale publishing endeavors, launched by designers, writers, and artists, align with the pragmatic social outlook \r\nof the contemporary creative scene. Rob Giampietro has observed that his peers are more inclined to collaborate with a \r\ngroup than push their individual identities: Â«The designers I know are Pragmatists. Their preferred site is not commerce, the \r\nstate, the academy, or the design press, but the Internet and the nonprofit organization. Neither hierarchical nor individualisÂ­\r\ntic, the Pragmatistsâ€™ chief structure is the collective, the band, or the project working group.... Their mode is not one of mass \r\nbut of localized production. Their interest in the design object extends beyond its construction to encompass the circumsÂ­\r\ntances of its distribution and circulation.Â»8 Embracing action over form, such work looks outward, striving less to craft a \r\npersonal voice than to shape a situation.\r\nWorking in more familiar commercial territory, graphic designers have long counted publishing houses among their clients. \r\nDesign often steps away from the spotlight, especially in literary publishing. Yet the very poise and discretion of a wellÂ­proÂ­\r\nduced book legitimates the work, signaling that it has survived the publishing worldâ€™s brutal gauntlet of selection and excluÂ­\r\nsion. In contrast, commercial media (textbooks, magazines, junk mail) invite the frame to interfere with the way readers read \r\nand the way writers write. Headlines respond to layouts; copy conforms to word counts; captions, decks, and pull quotes \r\ncarve inroads to the main story. The frame takes over.\r\nOccasionally, a graphic designer proves that this labor of frameÂ­making is not only akin to authorship but actually is \r\nauthorshipâ€”and thus deserves a share of the credits, royalties, and other privileges the title accrues. A hugely successful \r\nprecedent is the book The Medium is the Massage, coauthored by Marshall McLuhan and graphic designer Quentin Fiore \r\nin 1967. Fiore initiated the project, sifting through McLuhanâ€™s published writings in order to produce a compact paperback \r\npacked with highÂ­contrast photos and highÂ­speed aphorisms. The book had no manuscript; it was pulled into shape by the \r\neditorial hand and eye of the designer.9 The history and impact of the McLuhan/ Fiore collaboration is the subject of a new \r\nbook, published in a similarly compact form, by Inventory Books in 2011.\r\nBruce Mauâ€™s book S, M, L, XL is a sixÂ­pound collaboration with architect Rem Koolhaas (1996).10 Mau, who had made his \r\nname designing luxurious volumes of\r\n critical theory for Zone Books, now laid claim to the authority of authorship by asserting that his treatment, selection, \r\nand sequencing of visual material deserved cover credit. He went on to produce his own midÂ­career monograph Life Style \r\n(2000)11 and the ecological treatise Massive Change (2004).12 The making of Massive Change required a team of writers, \r\nresearchers, designers, and editors. In elevating the designerâ€™s role within the publishing enterprise, Mau was rethinking what \r\nan author is as well.\r\nBooks about art and design are especially conducive to graphic engagement. Mau published Life Style and Massive Change \r\nwith Phaidon, a leading international publisher of texts about visual culture (including food). Numerous designers have \r\nformed their own publishing companies or imprints. Inspired to produce books from the bottom up, they have wielded their \r\ntaste, skill, and connections to launch such ambitious endeavors as Lars Muller Publishers (Baden), Unit Editions (London), \r\nand Fuel Publications (London).\r\n The phrase Â«designer as authorÂ» harbors a refusal, a bleep of denial. The humble preposition Â«asÂ» marks a fissure between \r\nidentity and aspirationâ€”a gasp of disbelief between who we are and who we wish to be. How has authorship changed from \r\nthe point of view of the writer? What became of the character said to have met his demise in the murderous hands of postÂ­\r\nmodernism? Let us now observe the rakish ways of theundead.\r\nThe Author\r\nIn 2004, Bernadette Corporation, a collective of artists known for organizing\r\nÂ«spontaneous, purposeless eventsÂ» and producing a fashion label, an art magazine, and a series of films, wrote the novel \r\nReena Spaulings.13 As an object, Reena Spaulings resembles any otherâ€”bound in paper, set in Garamond, and printed on \r\ncreamy, mediumÂ­grade stock. What makes the book unusual is the way it was written. Reena Spaulings is said to be comÂ­\r\nposed by one hundred fifty writers, who worked together like a Â«stableÂ» of Hollywood screenwriters. The resulting book is \r\nas\r\nÂ«generic and perfectÂ» as any other corporate product. As Bernadette Corporation proclaimed in the preface: Â«An author is a \r\nroutine, which makes for good conversation whenever that routine climbs down from the windswept seclusion that walks \r\nand breathes centuries of the word.... (A)n author is a person who writes, but also a role to be negotiated and trained by \r\nthose who choose the books that can be read\r\ntoday. Becoming an author is a process of subjectivation, and so is becoming a soldier, becoming a cashier, becoming a potted \r\nplant (viiÂ­viii).Â»\r\nBernadette Corporation thus defined authorship as a performance, a ritual enactment of social roles. Michel Foucault referÂ­\r\nred to this special kind of roleÂ­playing as the Â«author function.Â» The notion of authorship emerged during the Renaissance, \r\nwhen church and state moved to hold people accountable for transgressive speech: the author became someone who could \r\nbe punished for what he said. As the publishing industry formalized in the eighteenth century, the author became a person \r\nwho owned the rights to a work and enabled it to be sold and circulated.\r\nAn author is a particular kind of individual whose identity is tied not to specific human actions or attributes but to a body \r\nof texts. Writing in 1972, Foucault predicted that as society changed, the author function would disappear. Questions about \r\nthe originality and intentions of the writer would succumb to new questions about the social life of the text: Â«What are the modes of existence of this discourse? Where has it been used, how can it circulate, and who can appropriate it for himÂ­\r\nself?Â»14 In the age of selfÂ­publishing and social media, the author function has splintered and multiplied. Society has chanÂ­\r\nged, and so have the means of composing, consuming, and spreading the written word. Â«AuthorÂ» is now a role that anyone \r\ncan play.\r\nWriter Tao Lin experiments with authorship as performance. The deadpan, shortÂ­beat prose of his harsh little novella ShoÂ­\r\nplifting from American Apparel (2009) aspires to the voicelessness of text messaging.15 (Read it on your iPhone.) Mocking \r\nthe media hype that ricochets around contemporary writers, Lin produces a flurry of selfÂ­promotion around his toneless \r\nnovels, including a thirdÂ­person, selfÂ­authored, New YbricerÂ­style profile published in Seattleâ€™s The Stranger. (The profile \r\ncomes with a dramatic headshot modeled after Jonathan Franzenâ€™s portrait on the cover of Time magazine).16 As founder \r\nof Muumuu House, Lin has become an indie publisher as well, issuing such unlikely works as Megan Boyleâ€™s book of poems \r\nSelected Unpublished Blog Posts of a Mexican Panda Express Employee (2011).\r\nItâ€™s easier to play publisher if you know something about graphic design. Accessible digital tools invite writers to play with \r\nthe space of the book while enabling designers to become authors and editors.\r\n Dave Eggers, a selfÂ­described hack designer and Macintosh temp, founded Timothy McSweeneyâ€™s Quarterly Concern in \r\n1998. Since then, McSweeneyâ€™s has celebrated the physicality of print while actively exploring the business of independent \r\npublishing. Today, a wide range of digital technologies are enabling authors to become publishers. Seeking to break into the \r\nrestricted world of publishing or to break away from unfavorable royalty schemes, designers and writers are experimenting \r\nwith print on demand, selfÂ­publishing, and digital editions. Borrowing the concept of justÂ­inÂ­time production from Toyota \r\nMotor Corporation, David Reinfurt and Stuart Bailey have looked at ways to publish material responsively in small batches, \r\nconsuming fewer resources and less warehouse space. Scott Thomas, design director of Barack Obamaâ€™s 2008 US presidential \r\ncampaign, selfÂ­published the book Designing Obama, selling print and digital editions directly from his own website; Thomas \r\nused the online crowdÂ­funding platform Kickstarter to finance the project.\r\n Desktop publishing started closing the divide between design and writing in the 1980s. Muriel Cooper, founder of the \r\nVisible Language Workshop at MITâ€™s Media Lab, was among the first to take the leap. With access to earlyÂ­generation \r\ndigital typesetting equipment, Cooper was equipped to imagine a new mode of production: Â«The author would be the maker \r\ncontrary to the specialization mode which makes the author of the content the author, the author of the form the designer, \r\nand the author of the craft the typographer/printer.Â» 17 Implicit but not stated in Cooperâ€™s proposal was a further revoluÂ­\r\ntion: authorship would become a collaborative effort.\r\n Shared authorship is now commonplace, ranging from the infinite enterprise of Wikipedia to smaller projects such as ColÂ­\r\nlaborative Futures, a book successively rewritten and reissued via group Â«book sprints.Â»18 Such activities speak to a generaÂ­\r\ntion of readers and writers whose view of intellectual property is skeptical at best. Seth GrahameÂ­Smith spawned a grossly \r\nsuccessful literary franchise when he issued Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009), a book he created by downloading Jane \r\nAustenâ€™s public domain classic and adding zombie action to every page.19 In the UK, the Piracy Project is exploring bootleg \r\npublishing in the developing world, where unauthorized editions often tamper with the original text.20 Will Holderâ€™s project \r\nThe Middle of Nowhere is authored by\r\n Â«translatingÂ» William Morrisâ€™ 1876 Utopian fantasy News from Nowhere into a new guide for design education and practice \r\nset in the year 2135.21\r\n For many authors working today, visualizing text is part of the writing. Anne Carson, Jonathan Safran Foer, Aleksandar HeÂ­\r\nmon, W. G. Sebald, Reif Larsen, and others have let pictures, typography, and layout intrude upon the hushed interior of liteÂ­\r\nrary discourse. Ignoring criticsâ€™ complaints about graphic Â«bells and whistlesÂ»22 and Â«razzleÂ­dazzle narrative techniques,Â»23 \r\nthese authors canâ€™t resist the seductive allure of the selfÂ­reflexive page. 24 Foerâ€™s novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close \r\n(2004) includes drawings, editorâ€™s marks, pages left blank, and pages set so tight the text becomes an unreadable blotch. 25\r\n Larsen sparked a storm of publicity when, as a young Columbia MFA graduate, he unleashed a bidding war among top \r\npublishers for The Selected Works of T. S. Spivet, the notÂ­yetÂ­comingÂ­ofÂ­agetale of a prepubescent cartographer raised on \r\na ranch in Montana. The margins of Larsenâ€™s book contain dozens of maps, diagrams, drawings, and footnotes depicting the \r\nprotagonistâ€™s curious and precocious mind. The reading experience is surprisingly intuitive; not so surprisingly, critics have \r\ngriped about the bookâ€™s visual showmanship. Writing for the New York Times, Ginia Bellafante described T. S. Spivet as \r\nÂ«burdened by device.Â»27 Writers, it would seem, should stick to writing.\r\n Although Larsenâ€™s book employs the old medium of ink on paper, its production required the suite of digital tools that have \r\ntransformed book design over the past quarterÂ­century. These tools have changed the way a generation of writers thinks \r\nabout books. What a page looks likeâ€”its shape and scale, its deployment of type and white spaces, its use of photographs, \r\ndiagrams, and scholarly devicesâ€”are functions of the visual frame. The ability to engage that frame is among the defining \r\nresources of writers working today.\r\n In their everyday lives, people today are writing more than ever. The vocabulary of SMS has upgraded Â«textÂ» from noun \r\nto verb. The telephone, invented to deliver the living human voice, is now used for writing more than talking. Design is \r\nbecoming universal as well, losing its expert edge and slipping into the mainstream culture. The production of websites, \r\nbrochures, news articles, and even business cards is now part of basic college writing courses. 27 In schools of journalism, the \r\nphrase Â«everyone works on everythingÂ» marks the collapse of thinking, making, and publishing into a continuous process.2B\r\nFor ail this talk of the selfÂ­empowered page, the lateral spread of publishing may have degraded its status overall. In a culture \r\nwhere everyone is a writer and writing is everywhere, the socioeconomic value of text production is falling. Terms like \r\nÂ«content management,Â» Â«content provider,Â» and Â«content farmÂ» underscore the generic, byÂ­theÂ­yard exchange of text in the \r\ndigital marketplace. As Foucault pointed out, not all writing achieves the imprimatur of authorship: a letter or a contract may \r\nhave a signatory, but we do not call this person an author.29 Others who may fail to qualify as authors are the writers who \r\npump out responses to commonly posed questions on Ask.com, or the readers who submit their personal stories to the ChicÂ­ken Soup for the Soul franchise. Crowdsourcing lowers the manufacturing cost of contentâ€”that elusive commodity that so \r\nmany people want but few are willing to pay for. Meanwhile, Â«black hatÂ» search engine optimization uses phony content to \r\nsend unwitting clicks to dubious websites. Phrases such as cloaking and auto blogging populate this wild frontier of nonÂ­auÂ­\r\nthored content, whose primary purpose is to game Google.\r\n In Barthesâ€™ boldly envisioned future, the reader would be beneficiary to the authorâ€™s estate, inheriting a wealth of opportuÂ­\r\nnity. Authorship was about pinning down the edges of a text and sealing off its borders; reading, in contrast, would be active, \r\nopen, generative, infinite. So what became of the reader? Since the turn of the twentyÂ­first century, we have seen collaboraÂ­\r\ntive, automated, and selfÂ­authored publishing endeavors assault the norms of authorship, while writers and designers alike \r\nhave employed typography and page formats as worldÂ­shaping devices. The recipient of this lavish surplus was supposed to \r\nbe the reader. Where, oh where did she go?\r\nThe Reader\r\n In a 2011 interview, novelist Gary Shteyngart observed that in our contemporary culture of selfÂ­expression, many people \r\nwould rather write than read. MFA programs in creative writing are swarmed with applicants while bookstores die of \r\nthirst.30 The tables at international book fairs sag beneath a bounty of selfÂ­published volumes, yet the wares on viewâ€” \r\noften insular and obscureâ€”celebrate the social act of publishing as much as any endÂ­user experience. If you are reading \r\nthis text now (and you started perusing it from the beginning, some three thousand words ago), you are a stalwart slogger \r\nindeed. The super sad truth is, this essay is a lastÂ­ditch effort at soÂ­called Â«longÂ­form writing.Â»\r\n Whenever I hear the word Â«reader,Â» I reach for my mobile device. Todayâ€™s Â«readerÂ» is as likely to be a digital apparatus or \r\na software interface as a living person leafing through the pages of a book. Countless hardware and software products are \r\ndesigned to display, filter, push, and aggregate published matter. Screen readers turn text into speech, creating accessible \r\nmaterial for sightÂ­impaired users. News readers digest blogs and news posts, feeding them back to users in quickÂ­view forÂ­\r\nmats stripped of context, while digital readers serve up books and magazines for instant consumption.\r\n Consumer gear such as Amazonâ€™s Kindle and Appleâ€™s iPad are changing the way we buy and read books. Such devices appear \r\nideally suited for consuming linear narratives. Whether pushing a button or swiping a screen, the user of an eÂ­book tends to \r\nmove steadily ahead through a document, loading one screen of content after another. Although digital bookmarks supÂ­\r\nposedly free users to wander about, it takes courage to resist the forward momentum of the medium. (In contrast, it feels \r\nless risky to flip back and forth through the pages of a printed book.)\r\n The insistent linearity of eÂ­pubs reflects how these publications are made. The process of designing a digital book requires \r\nlinearizing its content, ensuring that one element follows the next in a strict sequence. Tables, illustrations, and captionsâ€”\r\nwhich might appear in countless configurations on a printed pageâ€”obey strict marching orders in the eÂ­pub world: singleÂ­\r\nfile, one by one.31\r\n Attributes of the physical device further tighten the shackles of linearity. If networked computing signaled the ascendance \r\nof nonlinear communication, eÂ­readers are funneling content back in line. While the desktop favors a layering of windowsâ€”\r\nand frequent movement among themâ€”the tablet grips the user firmly in place, creating focus and limiting distraction. \r\nInterface designer Oliver Reichenstein has observed, Â«On a computer... the user visually moves between monitor, OS, app \r\nwindow, and the inner visual order of the window. On the iPad, eye and hand movement are brought together and held capÂ­\r\ntive within a massive black frame.Â»32\r\n Being held in captivity can be a plea surable relief from the relentless distractions of digital lifeâ€”especially if one is reading \r\nworks of fiction. In a 2010 study conducted by user experience expert Jacob Nielsen, respondents reported having more \r\nÂ«funÂ» reading an eÂ­book than a printed book. 33 Nielsenâ€™s subjects were reading short stories by Hemingway; there may be \r\nno prose on Earth better suited to linear consumption.\r\n Focus and distraction, linearity and nonlinearity: these conflicting categories of form and experience define who we are as \r\ncontemporary makers and users of media. We hunger for focus because we feast on distraction; we crave linearity because \r\nwe so often drift off task. ReadÂ­later apps enable users to gather links and absorb them at another time in an adÂ­free, typoÂ­\r\ngraphically hygienic environment.\r\n Sometimes, distraction is just what youâ€™re looking for. When I ask groups of graduate students if they have ever read a \r\nbook on Google Books, most solemnly shake their heads no and then muse upon printâ€™s undying fitness to a proper reading \r\nexperience. Then I reword the question: Â«Have you ever used Google Books?Â» The answer now shifts to yes. The screens \r\ngenerated by Google Books have nothing to do with focused immersion in a linear work of art (what school teachers call \r\nÂ«reading for pleasureÂ»). Instead, Google Books fuel that hungry, acquisitive, purposeÂ­driven mode of reading known as \r\nÂ«research.Â» At the root of Â«researchÂ» is Â«search,Â» the core business of the Google enterprise.\r\n Google Books offers up pages (or rightsÂ­restricted snippets of pages) scanned directly from printed volumes. Slicing \r\nthrough entire bodies of literature, Google preserves the typographic layout of the original work and marks it with yellow \r\nhighlights where the search engine has found a match. Floating around these fragments of slaughtered books are ads and \r\nlinks beckoning readers to go elsewhere: buy this book, find it in a library, see more like this, and so on. In the domain of \r\nsearch, distraction reigns triumphant. An author who has drafted an essay in the pastoral seclusion of iA Writer, or a reader \r\nwho has drifted through a contextÂ­free news feed, may eagerly return to the bustling metropolis of the digital desktop, \r\nwhere texts unwind amidst the clamor of notes, outlines, search windows, abandoned drafts, eÂ­mail streams, toÂ­do lists, and \r\nother (welcome) distractions.\r\n Reading means many things. A word that once evoked ladies perched on shady park benches now refers to machines and \r\nsoftware. Reading, like writing, has become a social activity, as consumers use digital means to rate, review, share, and annoÂ­\r\ntate texts in networked spaces. Reading can be active or passive, quick or close, public or private, willfully archaic or electroÂ­\r\nnically juiced. Designing environments to support these diverse functions draws on many areas of contemporary practice, \r\nfrom graphic identity, page layout, typography, and user experience to product design and software engineering. Designers and writers are using digital publishing tools to grow their own content and grapple with the materiality of \r\ntext. Web distribution and printÂ­onÂ­demand technologies offer accessible channels for shortÂ­run, lowÂ­risk publishing. The \r\nefflorescence of homespun media is part of the farÂ­flung doÂ­itÂ­yourself impulse, reflected everywhere from Etsy to Creative \r\nCommons, from yarnÂ­bombing to desktop manufacturing. At the heart of DIY is doing. To do something is to perform an \r\naction. (What did you do today? Made my bed, brushed my teeth, fed my sustainable robot, watered my urban farm.) For the \r\ndoÂ­itÂ­yourself author or entrepreneur, design is often the means to a larger end, whether itâ€™s publishing a book or promoting \r\na business (or publishing a book to promote a business).\r\n In our day and age, what are books for? What do they do? Books serve not just to be read but also to be displayed, exchanÂ­\r\nged, reviewed, collected, shelved, archived, reproduced online, and circulated in libraries. Designers today use books, blogs, \r\nand zines as outlets for soÂ­called Â«personal work.Â» Projects once called Â«promotional piecesÂ» are now said to be Â«selfÂ­puÂ­\r\nblished.Â» For writers, the jaunty motto Â«independent publishingÂ» has replaced the dismissive Â«vanity press.Â» At some level, \r\nselfÂ­publishing is a tool for disseminating the self, serving to manufacture evidence of a coherent voice and put it on display. \r\nA creative career becomes a brand. Authors, artists, designers, and collectives use publishing to construct public practices \r\nthat might include lectures, teaching, workshops, and exhibitions along with professional commissions.\r\n In addition to serving such social functions, books are made in order to be made. The process of publishingâ€”and the allure \r\nof a tangible outcomeâ€”becomes its own reward. As we labor to make a book, the pulsing hallucination of the finished thing \r\nbeckons us onward. In the end comes the end product, but looking back we often find that doing the thing was the best \r\npart.\r\n Has authorship met its end? When the author died, his ashes drifted over the open seas of digital connectivity, equipÂ­\r\nping new populations to broadcast ideas. Todayâ€™s allÂ­access mediascape has flattened out many areas of expertise, casting \r\nshadows of doubt upon the future of journalism, graphic design, book publishing, and other specialized practices. As the \r\ncreative process merges with production, some designers will grow more involved with systems and services than with besÂ­\r\npoke page layouts and letterpress business cards. Yet the object of art, no matter how small, still propels us into the orbit of \r\nits making. Aesthetic artifactsâ€”whether physical or digital, unique constellations of word and image or codeÂ­driven aggreÂ­\r\ngatesâ€”are part of communicationâ€™s uncertain future. \r\nâ€”Ellen Lupton\r\nNotes\r\n1.
